# An Immune System for Actor-Based Smart Homes
The use of Internet of Things technology in smart homes enables the establishment of networks of interconnected devices, sensors, and systems. These devices can communicate and exchange data with one another. However, any of these sensors or devices may fail or malfunction over time. This is where a smart home immune system that can detect and report anomalies comes in useful.

The idea of "self-awareness" is required to establish an Immune system in a smart home. We were able to understand the general behavior of the smart system as well as each of the sensors and actuators using deep learning methods such as word embedding, sequence-to-sequence, auto-encoders, and long-short-term memory network (LSTMs). This training helps us to improve the system's self-awareness.
We require external data to assess models and offer solutions. As a result, we built a smart house model in the Ptolemy utilizing an Accessors-based software architecture. In an event log file, this architecture captures communication messages between each part of the smart home. This data is used to train and test models and algorithms.

Finally, we were able to build and deploy an immune system in the smart home by combining actor models with deep learning techniques. This application has significance for bringing self-awareness to the smart home and eliminating the need for human involvement in identifying abnormalities and diagnosing their causes.
